# lmms2midi
Basic converter of an LMMS project file to a MIDI file format

System requirements:
  - Python 2.6 or higher
  - midiutil python library (https://github.com/duggan/midiutil)

Usage:

Please note: This converter works with uncompressed LMMS project files only. 

So you first need to save the project with the .mmp extension - add it manually to the filename in the Save Project dialog.
